# NODAG

Building on the findings of "[Validating Causal Diagrams of Human Health Risks for Spaceflight: An Example Using Bone Data from Rodents](https://www.mdpi.com/1813442)", this project explores the validation of expert-drawn directed acyclic graphs by comparing them to graphs generated by running the [NODAG algorithm](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2006.03005) on empirical biological data from the NASA Open Science Data Repository.
